# LittleRedRidingHood
Game written in FreePascal with Lazarus IDE, to test and improve OGLCScene and ALSound library.  
    
Enjoy!  

## Supported platforms
Windows 64b (tested on Win10)  
Windows 32b, 7 and + (tested on Win7 32b)  
Linux 64b,GTK2 (tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)  


## How to compile
You must have Lazarus IDE installed on your system with BGRABitmap package.  
Create a directory named "littlered" on your disk and into it do the following:
- clone this repository or download the zip.
- clone the repository [UnitsCommon](https://github.com/Lulu04/UnitsCommon). If you choose to download the zip, unzip it and rename the obtained directory to "UnitsCommon".
- clone the repository [ALSound library](https://github.com/Lulu04/ALSound). If you choose to download the zip, unzip it and rename the obtained directory to "ALSound".
- clone the repository [OGLCScene](https://github.com/Lulu04/OGLCScene). If you choose to download the zip, unzip it and rename the obtained directory to "OGLCScene".

The directory structure should be like:  
`|- saynetes`  
`    |- ALSound`  
`    |- LittleRedRidingHood (if you clone the repository) or LittleRedRidingHood-main (if you download ZIP)`  
`    |- OGLCScene`  
`    |- UnitsCommon`  
  
Now, you are able to open the Lazarus project in the directory LittleRedRidingHood or LittleRedRidingHood-main.
